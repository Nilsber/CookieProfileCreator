This is an alternative to Roblox Account Manager, which has been apparently infested with a trojan. Enjoy this simple UI that lets you get into a game on your alt account quickly. For safety reasons, it only opens the game, than just making you immediately join it. 100% of the code has been generated by ChatGPT

To begin, you obviously need to download Python, which will handle all of the things in the python script.

After you installed Python, open a Command Prompt and install all necessary libraries with these commands:

`pip install selenium`
`pip install tkinter`
`pip install webdriver-manager`
`pip install requests`

Because it uses selenium as a library, and the script creates an empty Chromium session, you will probably need to also install the Chromium browser.
